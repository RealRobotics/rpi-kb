# Real Robotics Raspberry Pi knowledge base

This repo contains information on how to set up Raspberry Pis for work with robotics and measurement platforms at the University of Leeds.

## Eduroam

At home, it is natural to connect a Raspberry Pi to the internet using your home Wi-Fi.  Eduroam is the Wi-Fi network for the university so it is natural for all Raspberry Pis to be connected to Eduroam at some point.
__However, due to the often lax security on Raspberry Pis caused by poor passwords etc., it is recommended that the Raspberry Pis are only connected to Eduroam during updates etc. and are disconnected afterwards.__

The documentation for confecting to Eduroam is [here](eduroam/eduroam.md).
