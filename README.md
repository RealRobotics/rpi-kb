# Real Robotics Raspberry Pi knowledge base

This repo contains information on how to set up Raspberry Pis for work with robotics and measurement platforms at the University of Leeds.

## SD card images

Raspberry Pi provides a nice tool to download and create an SD card image for the operating system (OS) along with great instructions, so use them! [See here for details.](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

The micro SD card should be as fast as possible and 16GB or larger.  My personal preference is the 32GB SanDisk Extreme micro SD cards.  You can get them from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDHC-Adapter-Performance/dp/B06XWMQ81P/ref=asc_df_B06XWMQ81P/) or Science Warehouse.

## Eduroam

At home, it is natural to connect a Raspberry Pi to the internet using your home Wi-Fi.  Eduroam is the Wi-Fi network for the university so it is natural for all Raspberry Pis to be connected to Eduroam at some point.
__However, due to the often lax security on Raspberry Pis caused by poor passwords etc., it is recommended that the Raspberry Pis are only connected to Eduroam during updates etc. and are disconnected afterwards.__

The documentation for confecting to Eduroam is [here](eduroam/eduroam.md).
