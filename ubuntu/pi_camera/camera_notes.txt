Write up these configuration notes on the RR lab site and in Pipebots.


Installing libcamera does nothing.  No apps usable. 32bit only?

This post susggests installing `raspi-config` and then enabling legacy camera support.

The camera was then visible in 

```bash
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
bcm2835-codec-decode (platform:bcm2835-codec):
	/dev/video10
	/dev/video11
	/dev/video12
	/dev/video18
	/dev/video31
	/dev/media1

bcm2835-isp (platform:bcm2835-isp):
	/dev/video13
	/dev/video14
	/dev/video15
	/dev/video16
	/dev/video20
	/dev/video21
	/dev/video22
	/dev/video23
	/dev/media0
	/dev/media2

mmal service 16.1 (platform:bcm2835-v4l2-0):
	/dev/video0
```

I was then able to run the camera using:

```bash
. /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run v4l2_camera v4l2_camera_node &
rqt &
```

Legacy camera support seems wrong.  Needs to be fixed.

This issue seems to get ot the heart of the matter but misses details.
